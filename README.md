## How to use

This is a standard LaTeX Beamer template. Just edit and go. As you can see from the PDF preview, the theme is "clean."

The `\defbf` macro makes text bold and gold-colored.

Note that `theorem` and related `amsthm` environments are modified to fit the color theme.

The numeral preceding an `\item` in an `enumerate` list is cardinal-colored.

An `\item` in an `itemize` list is marked via a cardinal-colored triangle.
